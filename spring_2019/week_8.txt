Week 8:
## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Started doing research on Networking for the development of a server. I was learning how to use TCP and UDP to create connections and take in data from a client network.

## This Week's Plan
> Build a usable server that can read input data from a client and then use said input data to make moves in a game.

## Anything Blocking?
> I have no experience with Networking so this is very difficult.

## Notes
> None
