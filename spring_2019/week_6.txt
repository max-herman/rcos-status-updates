Week 6:

## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Learned more on developing a game through godot, feel confident in my ability to program and create test games for the project.

## This Week's Plan
> We are no longer using the godot path, so now I have to start down a new work path. I may keep working on game development but now in Unity, or start working on the Networking part of the project.

## Anything Blocking?
> Disappointing I have to stop working on godot, but excited to learn a new topic to contribute to this project.

## Notes
> None
