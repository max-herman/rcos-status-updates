Week 7:

## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Talked with the project manager and decided to start work on the networking side of the project. I will be developing a
> server to connect to a client and take in data regarding player movements. This data will be translated to keybound inputs
> and effectively give the user the ability to play computer games by using their phone as a controller.

## This Week's Plan
> I want to start researching Networking programming to develop a server. I am learning how to use TCP and UDP to create connections and take in data from a client network.

## Anything Blocking?
> Difficult to learn a new topic so fast, but it needs to get done.

## Notes
> None
