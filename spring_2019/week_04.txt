## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I started to learn a new game engine, godot, and a new programming language which is utilizaed in godot, GDscript.
> Through this, I found that GDscript is very similar, almost identical, to python; but with elements of C#. I also found
> that godot is just a slower unity game engine, and should not take more than a week to learn enough and start work.

## This Week's Plan

> Learn how to develop a game through godot and possibly start work on project development.

## Anything Blocking?

> Learning how to develop a game through godot

## Notes
