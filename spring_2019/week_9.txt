Week 9:
## Last Week's Accomplishments
> Started development for both servers and the binder. Had to do more research on TCP and UDP servers and the Robot library.

## This Week's Plan
> Fully develop both servers, TCP and UDP, and the binding program. I only need to finish implementing a few features and then debug.

## Anything Blocking?
> The robot library wouldnt let me use the keypress commands due to conflicts with linux, this made it difficult to test the program.

## Notes
> None
