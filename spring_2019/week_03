## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I continued to develop the extendable sidebar for the website. This will contain all the settings for the
> user, including ip address, port, username / password, and different themes.

## This Week's Plan

> Since our project has hit a roadblock and we will be scrapping what we have done, I will be learning Godot and not continue
> developing the app with html/css/javascript. I will also be learning GDscript, the language paired with Godot.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not as of now.

## Notes

> None
